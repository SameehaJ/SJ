## Hi there! I'm Sameeha.

🔍 I love asking "why" and letting the data figure out "how".
📚 Currently diving into Python for data analysis exploring numpy, pandas, and matplotlib 
🛠️ Tools I use: Power BI, Excel, SQL, Tableau (and always open to learning more!)
🎯 2025 Goals:
- Build 5 new end-to-end projects — from raw data to insights
- Use Python to automate boring stuff
- Try contributing to an open-source data project
- Maybe analyze my screen time vs. productivity (spoiler: not great) or the best time to buy cheap flights
  
☕ A cup of coffee + rainy day + a messy dataset = my perfect vibe.
